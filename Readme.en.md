**MacKeyMapper** is an AutoHotkey (AHK) script for Windows that remaps keys to create a macOS-like shortcut experience.  

If you're used to **Command (⌘)** on macOS and miss that functionality on Windows, this script helps make the transition more intuitive.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1️⃣ **Download the Latest Release**  
- Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/pauloricardo-ggs/MacKeyMapper/releases) page of the repository.  
- Download the **executable file** (`.exe`) or the **`.ahk` script**.  

2️⃣ **Run the File**  
- **If you downloaded the `.exe`**, simply **double-click** to start key remapping.  
- **If you downloaded the `.ahk`**, install [AutoHotkey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and then **open the script**.  

## ⚡ Auto-Start on Windows  
To have the script start automatically when Windows boots, follow these steps:  

1️⃣ **Copy the `.exe` or `.ahk` file to the startup folder:**  
`C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`  

2️⃣ **Restart your computer or log out and log back in to test.**  

Now the script will launch automatically every time you start Windows. 🚀  

## 🛑 How to Stop Execution  
1️⃣ **Open Task Manager**  

2️⃣ **Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` or right-click the Taskbar and select Task Manager.**  

3️⃣ **Find the "MacKeyMapper" process**  

4️⃣ **Right-click the process and select "End Task".**  

The script will now be terminated, and your keyboard will return to its normal behavior.  
To reactivate key remapping, simply run the `.exe` or `.ahk` file again. 🚀  

## 🖥️ Customization  
If you want to customize the shortcuts, edit the `.ahk` file using a text editor and adjust it according to your needs.
